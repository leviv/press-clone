    <h1>Where Is My Flying Car?</h1>
    <p class="author-name">J. Storrs Hall</p>

    <p class="summary">
      In Where Is My Flying Car?, engineer and futurist J. Storrs Hall sets out
      to answer the deceptively simple question posed in the book’s title. What
      starts as an exploration of the technical limitations of building flying
      cars evolves into an examination of the global economic stagnation that
      started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the
      suppression of cold fusion and nanotechnology to the rise of a
      counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective
      ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for
      global wealth creation and distribution. Hall then outlines a framework
      for a future powered by exponential progress—one in which we build as much
      in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance
      and wonder.

      <blockquote>
        There are many writers with optimistic visions of the future. However,
        the goals I most often hear are all the negation of negatives: cure
        cancer, eliminate poverty, stop climate change. . . . This is good, but
        it is not enough. [These techno-optimists] are content with bringing the
        whole world up to the current best standard of living, but not
        increasing it. In this context, I found Where Is My Flying Car?
        refreshing. Hall unabashedly calls for unlimited progress in every
        dimension.
